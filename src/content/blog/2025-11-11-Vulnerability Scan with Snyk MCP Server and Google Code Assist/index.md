Ensuring your open-source dependencies are free of security vulnerabilities is a crucial step in modern software development. With the combination of Snyk MCP Server and Google Code Assist, you can now perform quick, AI-assisted vulnerability scans directly within your development environment.

[Snyk](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/snyk-studio-agentic-integrations)

🧰 Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- VS Code installed
- Google Account for Google Code Assist and Synk

⚙️ Setup Steps

1. Install Google Code Assist on VSCode
   Open the VS Code Marketplace and search for [Google Code Assist extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Google.geminicodeassist) or click the extension icon on VSCode and search Google Code Assist.
   Click Install and reload your editor once the setup is complete.

2. Add the settings file
   Inside your repository, create the following configuration file:

```shell
mkdir .gemini
touch .gemini/settings.json
```

`settings.json`

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"Snyk": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "snyk@latest", "mcp", "-t", "stdio"],
			"env": {}
		}
	}
}
```

This file will help Google Code Assist interact with your project’s context and external tools like Snyk MCP Server.

3. Run the Vulnerability Scan
   Open the Google Code Assist panel in VSCode and enter the following prompt:

```
Tell me about any vulnerabilities found in my open source dependencies for this project
```

Then you will need to accept to use Snyk MCP server.

![accept mcp server](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vbk0lbbeq6ov2p2jexxm.png)

Tried the same prompt with https://github.com/forem/forem

I can also open a Snyk learn lesson for some of these vulnerabilities. Would you like me to open a lesson for any of the vulnerabilities?
