									I made Devolio to help you easily set up your own blog and portfolio website. It's a static site built with Astro and

					<h4>
						Experienced Software Engineer | Machine Learning & IoT Enthusiast | Passionate About Building Products That Make a Difference
					</h4>
					<p>
						Iâ€™m Koji, a dedicated software engineer with a knack for creating cutting-edge solutions that positively impact peopleâ€™s lives.
						With a degree from New York University and a diverse skill set including TypeScript, React, and Python, I thrive in fast-paced
						environments where I can tackle complex challenges and drive innovative product development.
					</p>
					<p>
						A bit about my journey: At Opentrons, I am developing desktop applications using Electron and touch panel applications for our
						new robot, Flex. Our main tech stack is React.js and TypeScript.
					</p>

					<p>
						At Ubiquiti, I played a key role in developing a sophisticated web application using React.js, TypeScript, Redux, Node.js, and
						PostgreSQL. I also explored the exciting intersection of hardware and software, training machine learning models in Python while
						researching 3D camera possibilities. As a Resident Researcher at NYU ITP (2018-2019), I combined Raspberry Pi and machine
						learning to prototype creative solutions. I even built a generative art application with openFrameworks and Python, blending my
						technical expertise with a love for creative expression. Prior to that, I co-founded NGEMS, a web application development
						company recognized by NYC Media Lab's Combine 2018 cohort. As the lead engineer, I guided the team through the development of
						innovative applications, earning several awards along the way. Beyond these roles, Iâ€™ve always been passionate about blending
						machine learning, IoT, and art to push boundaries in tech.

				<h4>Whatâ€™s next?</h4>
				<p>
					Iâ€™m actively seeking my next challenge in software engineering, where I can continue to fuse creativity and technology. If youâ€™re
					looking for someone who brings a unique mix of technical proficiency, creative problem-solving, and a drive to make meaningful
					impact, letâ€™s connect!
